    <h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
    <p>Contrary to <mark> popular belief, Lorem Ipsum </mark> is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical 
        Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, 
        looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, 
        discovered the undoubtable source. <span> Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 </span>of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, 
        written in 45 BC. <mark>This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics,</mark> very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", 
        comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>

    <h2>Where can I get some?</h2>
    <p>There are many <strong> variations of passages of <em>Lorem Ipsum available, but</em> the majority have </strong>suffered alteration in some form, 
        by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need 
        to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing <em><span>hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet</span></em> tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. 
        It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, <p>Paragraph with <span style="color:teal;">teal</span> text.</p>
        combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. 
        The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>
