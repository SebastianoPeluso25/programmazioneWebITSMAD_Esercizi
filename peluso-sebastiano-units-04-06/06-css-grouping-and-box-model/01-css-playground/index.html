            <h3>The history of javascript</h3>
            <img src="https://bairesdev.mo.cloudinary.net/blog/2023/08/What-Is-JavaScript-Used-For.jpg" alt="">
            <p>In 1995 Netscape decided to equip its browser with a scripting language that would allow web designers to interact with the various objects on the page (images, forms, links, etc.), but above all with Java applets (programs that allow interaction with the user). In fact, in that very same year Netscape was close to Sun Microsystems (the creator of Java), with which it had entered into a partnership. Brendan Eich was entrusted with the project and invented LiveScript (so called to indicate its liveliness and dynamism).

                On December 4, 1995, the two companies announced the birth of this new language, describing it as "complementary to HTML and Java". The beta version of Netscape Navigator 2.0 therefore incorporated LiveScript, but - in homage to Java - Netscape decided to rename the new scripting language JavaScript.</p>

            <h3>What is SVELTE </h3>
            <img src="https://extelos.com/assets/images/blog/svelte.jpg" alt="">

            <p>Svelte is a UI framework that uses a compiler to let you write breathtakingly concise components that do minimal work in the browser, using languages you already know — HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It’s a love letter to web development.

                But don’t take our word for it. Developers consistently rank Svelte as the framework they’re most excited about using.</p>

        <h2>BREAKING NEWS</h2>
        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum</p>
